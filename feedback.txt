Nadia and Sveta: Safety checker for contries, with parser and translations
The program checkes real information and news related to antisemitism in any country.
It can check one country or compare two contries.
The news for each country are searched in the countries's language using module Translate and an API
and the general safety information is checked using Selenium (parser)

The structure is clear and organized, the code is easy to follow and functional.
OOP was beautifuly implemented, files are connected, the usage of the modules such as pycountry, Flask, Selenium and Translate is accurate and gives a lot of value to the project functionality.
The doc strings in the classes brings even more professionalism and shows that the project was made in pair :) 
Although the GUI using flask is simple, the logic and functionality bhrigths in this project.
