The billionaire attended the Atreju festival, which was hosted by the far-right Brothers of Italy party of Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, on Saturday (16 December) in Rome. Musk previously travelled to the Italian capital in June to meet with Meloni, who has , to discuss the dangers of artificial intelligence and Italy\u2019s declining population. Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Musk, who has 11 children, took to the Atreju stage with one of his kids to claim that having more children is the only way to reverse the population decline in Italy and other industrialised countries. If people didn\u2019t have more babies, Elon Musk alleged the somehow. \u201cWe are in danger of no longer having these countries,\u201d the billionaire Tesla owner said. Meloni\u2019s right-wing coalition government \u2013 which includes Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League and former PM Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right Forza Italia \u2013 has been preoccupied with addressing Italy\u2019s population decline, and has earmarked around \u20ac1 billion for measures in support of families with children. Yet, Meloni has made it her mission to attack LGBTQ+ families who have children. The prime minister has demanded Italian councils , only registering biological parents on the document. The move left same-sex couples in and rightfully fearful for their families\u2019 futures in the country. A lesbian mum was devastated by the removal of her name from her child\u2019s birth certificate, and she urged the government to think about all the families because of these hateful policies. In August, protestors gathered outside the Italian embassy in London to show solidarity for the country\u2019s LGBTQ+ community and . Giorgia Meloni has also publicly opposed surrogacy and adoption by queer couples. Her right-wing government is cracking down on gestational surrogacy \u2013 a practice already outlawed in Italy \u2013 and . Those found guilty could face a two-year jail sentence and a massive \u20ac1 million fine. Meloni reportedly made no mention of Musk in 2021. On top of asking people to have more babies, Elon Musk raged about a \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d that he believes is gripping the US. It\u2019s something he\u2019s been . When asked about , Elon Musk said he \u201cwill do well\u201d and believed the mass exodus is a \u201cshort-term problem\u201d.

Basic building blocks of everyday life that have been obliterated in many areas of the Gaza Strip as the Israeli bombardment following Hamas\u2019 deadly 7 October attacks stretches into its third month. With US president Joe Biden this week pointedly calling out the Israel military\u2019s \u2018indiscriminate bombing, many Palestinians feel that whatever happens next may be too little too late. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d says Palestinian lawyer Diana Buttu, former legal adviser to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). \u201c Gaza is now beyond repair. The physical damage cannot be fixed.\u201d Ms Buttu, who worked with the PLO and Israeli governments during the final Israeli-Palestinian peace talks between 2000 and 2004, believes the conflict has reached a point of no return. \u201cLet\u2019s assume the bombing stops tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cMost homes are uninhabitable \u2013 where do you send all these people? How do you provide for them? Where are the shops, the schools, the universities, the hospitals? \u201cIt will take years to even get to a place resembling a life, where do people go in the meantime?\u201d The United Nations said on Tuesday it had used its satellite analysis agency UNOSAT to determine that 18 per cent of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure had been destroyed since the October attacks. This includes at least 60 per cent of all housing units according to the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and 50 per cent of all infrastructure in the north of the strip. This infrastructure includes homes, hospitals, schools, universities and mosques. More than 77 per cent of Gazan hospitals are now non-operational according to the World Health Organisation and nine out of 10 Palestinians do not eat every day according to the World Food Programme. More than 85 per cent of the population, some 1.9 million people, are believed to have been displaced. And the breakdown of civilian infrastructure is bringing with it an impending breakdown of Palestinian society, it has been warned. \u201cWe are witnessing the beginning of the breakdown of civil order,\u201d an UNRWA spokesperson told The Independent . \u201cPeople are extremely anxious, extremely hungry, extremely scared. People have been going into one of our main food distribution shelters in Khan Yunis and fending for themselves. \u201cThat speaks volumes about their level of anxiety but also that it isn\u2019t possible anymore to conduct a proper, organised humanitarian operation. People are too scared, upset, angry and distressed \u2013 everyone is in survival mode.\u201d The Israeli Defence Forces have been adamant its military objectives are to eradicate Hamas, arguing the group uses Palestinian civilians as human shields in hospitals, homes and schools and that it is essential to ensure the national security of Israel. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Thursday: \u201cThe idea that Israel is somehow indiscriminately carpet bombing Gaza, this is simply just not true\u201c. A spokesperson for Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem said: \u201cEverything we\u2019ve seen in the last two months, we haven\u2019t seen before. \u201cThe scale and intensity of everything in Gaza and the West Bank as well as the intensity of Hamas crimes on October 7. Some of our Jewish and Israeli staff lost loved ones. A lot of people across the region are handling trauma and mourning right now. \u201cAll of this is worse than we\u2019ve ever seen, there\u2019s no question about it. But we can\u2019t go back to where we were before, which was an apartheid state.\u201d Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and various UN officials have concluded Israel as committing apartheid in their investigations, a claim that Israel vehemently denies and has called antisemitic. But the question of what Palestinians will come back to remains. Juliette Touma, a Director at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency told The Independent that Gaza is \u201cbecoming unliveable\u201d. She said: \u201cThis is the most challenging moment in the history of the UN for a number of medical reasons, but for UNRWA it\u2019s the most challenging moment in the 75-year history of the agency. People in Gaza have reached their darkest hour. \u201cIt\u2019s not even comparable to any of the conflicts that Gaza has had. This is no place for children, no place for human beings.

News Reports World Updated: 17 December, 2023 Canada: Amidst online Hinduphobic attacks on the new 55-feet Lord Hanuman statue in Brampton, temple decides to enhance security The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton is constructing a 55-foot-tall statue of the Hindu deity Hanuman, which will be inaugurated in April next year to commemorate Hanuman Jayanti. 17 December, 2023 OpIndia Staff Facebook Twitter Telegram Email WhatsApp 6 A temple in Canada\u2019s Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is increasing security after receiving complaints and discriminatory remarks on social media about a massive statue of Lord Hanuman being put up on its grounds. The Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton is constructing a 55-foot-tall statue of the Hindu deity Hanuman, which will be inaugurated in April next year to commemorate Hanuman Jayanti. According to a temple priest, the statue is 95% finished, with minor work on the pedestal remaining. Notably, in recent months Brampton has seen a surge in pro-Khalistan activity. In July, \u201c War Zone \u201d posters threatening Indian diplomats in Canada appeared outside the Bharat Mata Mandir in Brampton. Known for his expertise in sculpting Hindu deities, Rajasthan sculptor Naresh Kumawat is creating the Lord Hanuman statue. Kumawat has erected over 200 statues in more than 80 countries. Speaking to Hindustan Times, the temple priest Phool Kumar Sharma said , \u201cThere is security at our temple, and we will be keeping watch at night as well.\u201d Sharma stated that there have been complaints to the authorities as well as social media outrage by some people who are discontented with the statue\u2019s installation. The priest, however, clarified that the statue is sponsored by donations, is being made on the temple grounds and does not violate any municipal regulations. Notably, a section of Canadian netizens have unleashed a bigoted attack on the Hindu community over the statue of Lord Hanuman with many posting derogatory comments about Hindu Canadians and the Hindu gods as well. One Cosmin Dzsurdzsa wrote, \u201cHinduism is heavily invested in the meaning and power of symbols. Although Western thought has largely discounted religious symbolism as irrational and superstitious, ignoring an obvious projection of power in the form of a massive deific monument will be to our detriment. Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50-foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple? The psychological motivation is curious and a legitimate question.\u201d Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50 foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple?

Traditional Canadian culture is being erased, and people aren't happy. https://t.co/sS95zvwsPO \u2014 Joe Blo (@NormalGuy223) December 15, 2023 The same person had in a now-deleted post written, \u201cA 55-foot Hindu statue is going up in Brampton, Ontario\u2026.which is another reminder that we need an immediate halt on all immigration into Canada.\u201d Amusingly, the person opines that a mere statue of Lord Hanuman installed on a private property has power to \u2018erase\u2019 the \u2018Traditional Canadian culture\u2019. It is ironic that Canadians who day in and out boast to be the most tolerant and champions of religious freedom and free speech and whatnot are offended by a Hindu deity\u2019s statue being built on private land in absolute compliance with the local laws. The recent online attacks only expose the deep-seated hatred for the Hindu faith and Hindus in general. If we look at the data, according to a 2021 census , Canada has a Christian population of over 19.3 million making up over half of the Canadian population. It is interesting to note that India, a Hindu majority country is home to more Christians than a Christian majority Canada with a population of over 28 million, according to 2011 census data, making them the third largest religious community in the country. Despite being a Hindu majority nation, India has always been tolerant towards religious institutions, places of worship, statues etc. When Hindu temples are attacked by Khalistani terrorists, the same intolerant Canadians go into hibernation, yet go berserk over a 55-foot statue of a Hindu god, claiming that Hindu religious symbolism is being forced in a Christian-majority Canada. In recent months, Khalistani terrorists have attacked Hindu temples in several parts of Canada, vandalising the temples and defacing the walls with anti-India and anti-Hindu graffiti, with Canadian authorities taking no concrete action. The question arises as to how one immigrant community, whose places of worship are constantly subjected to hatred and attacks by extremist sections of another and yet remains law-abiding, will obliterate or destroy \u201cCanadian culture,\u201d which it does not seek to do.

When asked by CTV\u2019s Question Period host Vassy Kapelos in an interview airing Sunday whether she thinks the feasibility of a two-state solution has diminished since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Joly said she thinks \u201cthe contrary.\u201d \u201cI think because this conflict is so difficult for Israel, so difficult for the Palestinians, so difficult for the world, not only in Canada because we've seen the rise of antisemitism, the rise of Islamophobia and just the rise of tension,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that's the case here, that's the case in Europe, that's the case south of the border, that's the case in Arab countries,\u201d she added. \u201cSo more than ever, many, many countries are preoccupied by the state of the region.\u201d Joly said she believes that was \u201cnot as much the case\u201d before the Oct. 7 attacks, which have renewed a global focus on the Middle East, prompting her to have \u201cmany conversations\u201d on the topic with her counterparts in the region, because \u201cit is also in the interest of the world to see a two-state solution happening.\u201d The Canadian government has been calling for a two-state solution in the region, renewing that push in a recent joint statement with Australia and New Zealand, which also calls for \u201cefforts towards a sustainable ceasefire.\u201d \u201cWe've also said that Hamas being a terrorist organization should not be involved in any future governance of Gaza,\u201d Joly told Kapelos. \u201cBecause we believe that there is a path towards a two-state solution, and we need to make sure that we get to that two-state solution process.\u201d When asked what she thinks of the feasibility of such a compromise becoming a sustainable reality \u2014 considering only about a third of Israelis and Palestinians believe it is possible, according to some polling \u2014 Joly said \u201cthere is no other choice.\u201d \u201cAnd there's no other path,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need to have a constructive government in Israel that believes in the two-state solution, and we need to have the right Palestinian voices, which are not Hamas, that believe in it.\u201d \u201cIt's been 30 years that we've been talking about it, but there's been a lot of actions to undermine it, including on both sides,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I think as Western leaders, we have to reckon that we haven't done a good job enough to bring this solution to the table, talking about it, but not enough actions.\u201d Joly said she\u2019s \u201ccommitted\u201d to doing the work and finding the \u201cright parties at the table to give the right credibility,\u201d to those discussions. Joly in her interview also discussed whether she believes Israel has breached international humanitarian law in its response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, and whether Canada may ever designate Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist entity.

Probably pretty fair to say it only gets worse from here on out. Their decency looks an awful lot like degeneracy to me. Yeah, us too. Well at least there hasn't been any mean tweets. I miss mean tweets. Right? Those mean tweets were the REAL issue. Not some antisemitic staffer filming p0rn in a Senate Hearing Room. Sheesh.

La cantante se posicion\u00f3 a favor de Palestina y apunt\u00f3 contra Israel: \u201cMatar ni\u00f1es no es defensa propia\u201d, se ley\u00f3 durante su actuaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, durante la canci\u00f3n \u201cS\u00e9 que est\u00e1s mintiendo\u201d se pudo ver im\u00e1genes del primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. En tanto, la artista tambi\u00e9n record\u00f3 que \u201cen 60 d\u00edas\u201d de guerra, 21.731 palestinos murieron asesinados. El senador blanco Sebasti\u00e1n Da Silva escribi\u00f3 en su cuenta de X (antes Twitter): \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 hacen esto con la plata de los contribuyentes?\u201d, en referencia a la presentaci\u00f3n de la rapera. Porque hacen esto con la plata de los contribuyentes? pic.twitter.com/7tJcVFJIEG Por otro lado, el precandidato colorado Guzm\u00e1n Acosta y Lara expres\u00f3: \u201cPropaganda antisemita en el Montevideo Late, el festival que organiza la reina con dinero de los contribuyentes. Lamentable lo de esta mujer\u201d. De este modo, cuestion\u00f3 a la intendenta de Montevideo: \u201cLa verdadera pregunta es: \u00bfUruguay soportar\u00eda cinco a\u00f1os de un gobierno conducido por Carolina Cosse y un Frente Amplio radicalizado?\u201d. En tanto, el publicista Bruno Petcho tambi\u00e9n realiz\u00f3 un descargo en la red social. \u201cHoy Montevideo no late como deber\u00eda haber latido\u201d, comenz\u00f3. De acuerdo con el comunicdor, \u201cel pulso de miles de ciudadanos se aceler\u00f3 al escuchar como Eli Almic aprovech\u00f3 un festival organizado por la Intendencia de Montevideo para seguir sembrando antisemitismo\u201d. \u201cCriticar pol\u00edticas del gobierno de Israel no te hace antisemita. Pero cuando existe una intenci\u00f3n clara de demonizarlo, esa cr\u00edtica desmesurada o maniqueista, s\u00ed es una se\u00f1al grave de antisemitismo\u201d, apunt\u00f3. Petcho cuestion\u00f3: \u201c\u00bfAcaso a Eli Almic no le importa lo que est\u00e1 pasando hoy en Ucrania? \u00bfArmenia? \u00bfO en Ir\u00e1n? \u00bfEn Yemen? \u00bfEn Sudan? \u00bfEn el Congo? \u00bfLa cifra de muertes de palestinos en Siria no tuvo la suficiente cobertura medi\u00e1tica como para sobreimprimirla en su pantalla gigante? Fueron cientos de miles\u201d. \u201cMientras Eli Almic cantaba su canci\u00f3n \u2018S\u00e9 que est\u00e1s mintiendo\u2019 y cada vez que repet\u00eda el estribillo, la pantalla gigante acompa\u00f1aba su voz con im\u00e1genes del primer ministro de Israel. Ya que estaba tan interesada en hablar de actualidad, la noche de hoy hubiese sido una buena oportunidad para condenar las atrocidades de Ham\u00e1s mostrando alguno de los cientos de videos que los terroristas se hicieron violando, mutilando y asesinando israel\u00edes y personas de todas partes, y as\u00ed mostrarle al mundo de lo que son capaces estos fan\u00e1ticos religiosos. Pero quiz\u00e1s ella piense que en eso los israel\u00edes tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n mintiendo\u201d, agreg\u00f3. Hoy Montevideo no late como deber\u00eda haber latido. El pulso de miles de ciudadanos se aceler\u00f3 al escuchar como Eli Almic aprovech\u00f3 un festival organizado por la Intendencia de Montevideo para seguir sembrando antisemitismo en nuestra ciudad. Criticar pol\u00edticas del gobierno de\u2026 Si bien la cantante fue duramente criticada, tambi\u00e9n se pudo ver en redes sociales comentarios en los que halagaban su posici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y su mensaje. En 2019, Eli Almic tambi\u00e9n protagoniz\u00f3 un pol\u00e9mico show, en el marco de la Movida Joven organizada por la IM . En aquel entonces, en la canci\u00f3n \"S\u00e9 que est\u00e1s mintiendo\", la rapera us\u00f3 im\u00e1genes de varias figuras pol\u00edticas asociadas a la derecha, como Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Mauricio Macri y tambi\u00e9n Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou. En el caso de Lacalle, aparecen im\u00e1genes repetidas en las que el presidente electo se pasa los dedos por la nariz. La propia cantante cont\u00f3 en las redes sociales que recibi\u00f3 incluso amenazas de muerte por las visuales usadas en el show, aunque decidi\u00f3 luego borrar el comentario y agradeci\u00f3 el apoyo de muchas personas en el show.

The incident of doctors partying with alcohol reportedly took place inside the guest house of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). However, it was interrupted when someone barged in with a camera. As per reports, the party took place during the ongoing conference of paediatricians, Pedicon 2023, which is being organised at DMCH between 14-17 December. Notably, the visuals of the alcohol party were captured on camera. The footage revealed sealed imported liquor bottles abandoned on the floor after those consuming it quickly dispersed upon noticing the camera. After the visuals of medical professionals consuming alcohol in the dry state went viral, the Darbhanga Police sprung into action. Speaking with India Today TV, Darbhanga\u2019s Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Amit Kumar confirmed the authenticity of the viral visuals. He stated that raids were conducted at DMCH after the video emerged, leading to the recovery of three bottles of foreign-made liquor. Kumar said , \u201cIt is claimed that a liquor party was organised on the DMCH campus. All video evidence will be examined and people concerned questioned.\u201d Following the viral videos, opposition leaders launched a scathing attack on the Bihar government\u2019s claim of making Bihar a dry state. Sharing photographs of the incident, Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) chief Pappu Yadav alleged that the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) served as an \u201cadda for sharab, shabab and Kabab (hub for women, wine & dine)\u201d. He also claimed that he saw it firsthand when he was taken for treatment while in jail. \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u093c\u0930\u0940\u092c\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0936\u0930\u093e\u092c\u092c\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0915\u093c\u093e\u0928\u0942\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 DMCH \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093f\u092a\u0932 \u0914\u0930 \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0915\u093c\u093e\u0928\u0942\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e? \u0926\u0930\u092d\u0902\u0917\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0947\u0921\u093f\u0915\u0949\u0928 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u092b\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0936\u0930\u093e\u092c \u092a\u0930\u094b\u0938\u0940 \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0932\u0941\u0924\u094d\u092b\u093c \u0909\u0920\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0925\u0947, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u093e\u0938\u0928 \u0938\u094b\u0908 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0925\u0940, \u0906\u0916\u093c\u093f\u0930 \u0915\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u092f\u0939 \u091a\u0932\u0947\u0917\u093e?? \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0940 @NitishKumar \u091c\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0932\u0947\u0902 pic.twitter.com/vOIHVNGcRL \u2014 Pappu Yadav (@pappuyadavjapl) December 16, 2023 As per reports, the doctors caught in the viral frame included DMCH Principal Dr KN Mishra who outrightly denied the allegations. He claimed that he did not consume any alcohol and if anyone proves this, he will immediately leave his post. Regarding his presence at the alcohol party caught in the viral videos, he argued that someone had misused his photo and video as people could find his photo and video somewhere. According to him, the photo looks edited and he got information from news channels and newspapers. At the Pedicon conference, many doctors have come from Delhi, Mumbai, and Gujarat, for whom arrangements have been made to stay in many hotels and guest houses in the city. Now it is not possible to check their luggage, he further argued in his defence. He added that now that the incident has come to light, they are forming three to four investigation committees. This committee will investigate and submit a report in three days as to how and by whom the liquor was brought to the guest house. Presently Pedicon is going on in the guest house in which more than 509 doctors have come from outside. Regarding Pappu Yadav\u2019s allegations of setting up a liquor den, the DMCH principal added that if any doctor is caught drinking or sees someone drinking then they should tell the hospital authorities. He added that the Pedicon is not an organisation of DMCH, it is organised by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). In this institution, there are four times more doctors from outside Darbhanga than the number of doctors there, he added. It is important to note that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar imposed a ban on alcohol consumption in 2016, making it a dry state.

Virginia Foxx Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., discusses the negotiations on Capitol Hill over border funding and the House's probe into antisemitism on college campuses. While the economy is still the most important issue facing the country, the number of registered voters who feel that immigration/border security should be the top priority has increased by 8 percentage points since August, landing it firmly in second place. That surge comes as most think the immigration situation in the south is an emergency or a major problem and majorities support policies to strengthen the border. The latest Fox News Poll, released Sunday, finds 8 in 10 voters think the situation at the southern border is either an emergency (34%) or a major problem (45%). That\u2019s similar to views in October overall, except voters then were more likely to classify it as an emergency (48%) rather than a major problem (37%). Fox News Poll (Fox News) When it comes to shoring up the perimeter, the most favored tactic is increasing the number of border agents (79% favor). About two-thirds support deporting those here illegally (67% favor), penalizing businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants (64%), and allowing illegal immigrants who have U.S. jobs to stay and apply for legal status (62%). Fewer, although still majorities, favor using the U.S. military at the border (58%) and building a wall (54%). SENATE UNDER PRESSURE: SCHUMER CANCELS PART OF HOLIDAY RECESS TO ADDRESS LONG LIST OF TASKS There is bipartisan support for hiring more border agents (68% of Democrats favor and 93% of Republicans) and fining businesses for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants (53% and 78%). Fox News Poll (Fox News) But there are stark partisan differences on allowing those working in the U.S. to apply for legal status (80% of Democrats favor it vs. 40% of Republicans), sending troops to the border (36% vs. 82%), and constructing the wall (25% vs. 88%). Republicans overwhelmingly favor deporting illegal immigrants (89%) while Democrats are divided (48% favor, 44% oppose). One notable shift over the past several months: voters are more likely to favor deporting illegal immigrants now (67%) than they were in February (58%). Groups across the board are keener to send them back, including Democrats (+8 points), Republicans (+10), and independents (+11). When it comes to legal immigrants, 55% of voters think they do more to help the country while 37% think they hurt it. Fox News Poll (Fox News) Majorities of Democrats (73%) and independents (55%) feel legal immigrants help, while over half of Republicans say they cause harm (55%). Nineteen percent identify immigration/border security as the most important issue facing the country, up from 11% in August. The increase comes primarily from Republicans (+13 points) and men (+10) putting more importance on the topic than before. The economy is still by far the top priority to voters overall (35%). Republicans\u2019 top issues are the economy (40%) and immigration/border security (35%). The economy is also number one among Democrats (27%), but then importance splinters among others, such as guns (16%), climate change (13%), voting rights (12%), and abortion (10%) \u2013 hardly any say immigration (5%). Fox News Poll (Fox News) The Biden administration and Congressional Republicans are locked in a fierce debate over a spending package meant to send billions in aid to wars in Israel and Ukraine. Republicans are pushing to pair that aid with tougher border policies. EX-ICE CHIEF THOMAS HOMAN EYES \u2018HISTORIC\u2019 DEPORTATION IF TRUMP'S RE-ELECTED: \u2018NO ONE\u2019S OFF THE TABLE' One third of voters approve of how President Biden\u2019s handling border security (33%) while 63% disapprove. His approval on the border reached a high of 40% in May 2021 and hit a low of 30% last month, but it\u2019s mostly stayed between 33-37%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Immigration is fast becoming the paradigmatic example of government's incompetence,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw who conducts the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"There is no coherent policy to secure the border, and neither is there any immediate prospect for dealing with millions of undocumented workers in the U.S. The images from the southern border are both heartbreaking and appalling.\" CLICK HERE FOR TOPLINE AND CROSSTABS Conducted Dec. 10-13, 2023, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll included interviews with 1,007 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.
