Much of the rhetoric that divides college campuses, including claims that Israel is a \u201csettler-colonialist\u201d \u201capartheid\u201d state guilty of genocide against the Palestinians, has its roots in the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.

Critics respond that BDS is an inherently antisemitic effort to eliminate Israel as a Jewish state. Until last year, however, of BDS. That changed with the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas, as their tactics and their rhetoric. At Brown University, 41 students who demanded that the school divest \u201cfrom Israeli military occupation\u201d were after refusing to leave an administration building after hours. At Cornell University, a group of protesters, after finding the university\u2019s president in a mock trial, occupied the university\u2019s main administration building. At the University of Minnesota, the tenured faculty in the Gender and Women\u2019s Studies Department a lengthy statement on the department\u2019s website accusing Israel of a \u201cgenocidal war\u201d against the Palestinians and endorsing \u201cthe call by Palestinian civil society for BDS.\u201d And at Amherst College, on the school to divest from companies that \u201cdirectly profit \u2026 from the ongoing Israeli military operations that are laying Gazan life and society to waste.\u201d As anger at BDS-style rhetoric grows, demands to suppress antisemitism are growing with it. Government officials have threatened to defund colleges tolerating \u201c ,\u201d the Department of Education has opened investigations into antisemitism at , and donors and alumni have demanded college policies prohibiting \u201c \u201d as well as threats and violence. Brandeis University has pledged to to student organizations supporting the BDS movement because it \u201caims to dismantle the Jewish state.\u201d In effect boycotting the boycotters, the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville now to sign a pledge declaring they do not support BDS. The long-running controversy over BDS serves as a reminder, especially in the present heated environment, of the daunting challenge facing colleges and universities, which must fulfill two imperatives that are sometimes at odds. Hate speech (even when it is protected speech) attacks the dignity and worth of those subjected to it, undermines their sense of physical and emotional safety and is therefore \u201cinimical to learning.\u201d Many Jewish, Muslim and Arab students now feel unsafe on college campuses, and their learning is at risk. At the same time, the of academic freedom and free speech are \u201cthe very precondition of the academic enterprise itself.\u201d (These quotes come from the American Association of University Professors\u2019 1994 statement \u201cOn Freedom of Expression and Campus Speech Codes.\u201d) Those principles require tolerating even deeply offensive speech, of true threats, incitement to imminent unlawful action or harassment. Managing this tension has been rendered more problematic because many colleges and universities have not applied free-expression policies consistently, leading to of hypocrisy and left-wing bias.

But since then, a new man has taken up the shield. We can\u2019t wait to see what he does with it. The new Captain America joined the MCU during the Marvel series The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. That\u2019s between WandaVision and Loki if you\u2019re seeing all of the Marvel movies and TV shows in order. The second star-spangled man is Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie. He could be a very different Captain than Steve Rogers. So, what can Sam look forward to in his next Marvel movie? This is what we know. Table of Contents Captain America 4 Release Date After the end of the 2023 Hollywood strikes, Marvel Studios changed its whole release schedule and plans, which caused Brave New World to be pushed back by almost a year. This is now the last movie in Marvel\u2019s Phase 5. Who is in the Cast of Captain America 4? James Badge Dale, Harrison Ford, Liv Tyler, and Tim Blake Nelson are just a few of the actors who will be in Captain America 4. Daniel Ramirez will play Joaquin Torres again, also known as the \u201cnew Falcon.\u201d Harrison Ford will play Thaddeus Ross in this movie, which is also very exciting news. We should also say that he will play President Thaddeus Ross, who is one of the best MCU characters ever. That\u2019s correct. Ford is once again in charge of the White House. Here is the cast list for Captain America 4: It was directed by Julius Onah, who also made The Cloverfield Paradox. The story was written by Dalan Musson and Malcolm Spellman, who also worked on The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. What is the Story of Captain America 4? The name of the movie makes it sound like it will be based on a Marvel comic book story called \u201cNew World Order.\u201d The Red Skull tried to take over the world, which is what Marvel bad guys do in this story that spanned several books. Could the Red Skull come back, or will The Leader take his place? The Soul Stone was holding The Red Skull prisoner. That\u2019s gone now, though, so who knows? Did the Title of Captain America 4 Change? No real reason has been given for why Marvel changed the name. A lot of fans think it was to escape trouble, though. New World Order is not only the name of a group of bad guys in comic books; it\u2019s also the name of an antisemitic conspiracy theory. For good reason, Marvel probably wanted to stay away from any connections. As was already said, though, none of this has been proven and is just fan theory. Speculation about the Captain America 4 Trailer Conclusion Captain America 4 is set to release on February 14, 2025, following the release of Deadpool 3. The film stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, who may be a different Captain than Steve Rogers. The story is based on a Marvel comic book story called \u201cNew World Order,\u201d where the Red Skull tried to take over the world. The title has been changed to \u201cBrave New World\u201d to avoid controversy.

Why are authorities now arresting Jews protesting Israel's bombardment in Gaza and canceling events with Palestinians?", "content": "The principle of \u201cnever again\u201d is built into the very foundations of German national identity. The reasons should be obvious. German disavowal of its past through commemoration has become something of a gold standard for countries that have perpetrated unforgivable crimes. And yet, since Oct. 7, Holocaust memory has increasingly been invoked in Germany to suppress debate on Hamas militants\u2019 massacres of that day in Israel and the brutalities the Israel Defense Forces have meted out against Gaza Strip civilians in the aftermath. It appears that something has gone terribly awry in Germany\u2019s famed \u201cculture of memory.\u201d In Germany, it has become virtually impossible to stand against the IDF\u2019s violent targeting of Gazan civilians without being smeared with suspicions of antisemitism. The German-based Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation reportedly withdrew its support from co-sponsoring the Hannah Arendt Prize for political thought to journalist Masha Gessen because of an essay they wrote this month in the New Yorker, in which they drew parallels between Gaza and a Jewish ghetto . While this started before Oct. 7, what has been remarkable in the present crackdown is the inordinate number of Jews and Israelis in Germany now under attack for speaking out against the killing of civilians in Gaza. Even more disturbing is how many of them are being framed as antisemitic by German authorities, who similarly censure Arab and Middle Eastern communities who critique Israel. At stake here is not only the German process of reckoning with its own past, but also the very fate of \u201cnever again\u201d as an orientation around which we can make common cause against ongoing atrocity. Germany\u2019s memory culture rests on a basic conviction: that our ancestors are supposed to keep us honest in both their virtues and their sins, in how they lived, died, killed, were killed, took and were taken from. It is based on a conviction that public memory includes reckoning with both the unrepented crimes and the unredeemed injuries of our ancestors, and asks us to place these concerns at the center of our ethical imagination as we address not just the past, but also the present. German law thus forbids denial of the Holocaust . The country also criminalizes expressing racist and antisemitic hate speech as well as denying war crimes and genocide . Many in the international community have come to admire Germany\u2019s willingness to look inward for the enduring legacies of national crimes. And they would even like to see \u201cnever again\u201d expanded into an ethic that could be applied anywhere, rather than limited to a national or ethnic scope. In Germany, however, the promise of \u201cnever again\u201d has contracted. Too often, German authorities now surveil newly arrived immigrants \u2014 out of fear that they might \u201cimport\u201d antisemitism into the country \u2014 as well as the growing number of Jews who insist on their right not to see atrocities committed in their name. In Germany, Jews and Arabs are again placed under a special scrutiny. Over the last two years, for instance, demonstrations commemorating the anniversary of the Nakba, when Palestinians were displaced and Israel was created in 1948, have largely been outlawed . Of those who defied this ban, many were members of Juedische Stimme, or \u201cJewish Voice,\u201d a group of Jewish activists expressing solidarity with Palestinians. In last year\u2019s Nakba demonstration, the majority of those arrested were Jewish members of the group. Since then, things have only escalated. A leading member of Juedische Stimme who was born and raised in Israel was recently detained for a solitary protest in which she held a sign in a Berlin public square that read: \u201cAs a Jew and Israeli: Stop the genocide in Gaza.\u201d We can question the value of the term the protester used on her sign to describe what\u2019s happening in Gaza, but it\u2019s a debate we need to have. Meanwhile, an award ceremony at the Frankfurt Book Fair honoring Palestinian novelist Adania Shibli was canceled by organizers in October. Her novel \u201cMinor Detail\u201d explores a historical murder of a Bedouin Palestinian girl by Israeli soldiers, a topic considered too incendiary . A few weeks later, the Federal Agency for Civic Education canceled a symposium titled \u201cWe Still Need to Talk,\u201d which had been planned for early December. The event was intended to start a conversation about how the paradigm of Holocaust memory could create a space for reflection and solidarity embracing commonalities and differences between the Shoah and other events of historical trauma (colonial genocides, the legacy of American slavery, for instance). In a statement , the organizers, who included Michael Rothberg, chair in Holocaust studies at UCLA, and Candice Breitz, a Berlin-based artist whose work grapples with global geographies of race, opposed the decision to call off the event. Consider what we are seeing in these events. German police are arresting Jews for political expression criticizing the state of Israel, all in the name of combating antisemitism, while the German descendants of perpetrators (virtually all of us are) are declaring a proprietary expertise, accusing Jews and Arabs alike of not understanding the political purchase of antisemitism in our present. Out of a laudable conviction that we, as German descendants of perpetrators (sometimes victims), have a special responsibility when we see violence meted out against the defenseless has emerged a proprietary relationship to the aspiration of \u201cnever again.\u201d From subjecting the legacies of their own perpetration to scrutiny, German political institutions are increasingly directing scrutiny at others, framing antisemitism as a problem to be called out in others. If the optics here do not inspire a deep sense of unease, perhaps it is we who have not grasped the basic lessons of German history. I have spent much of my scholarly career working in countries where the naming of ethnic cleansing, apartheid and genocide are fiercely debated as political violence rolls on unchecked. I am no stranger to the fact that, as the often-abused turn of phrase goes, \u201cit\u2019s complicated.\u201d But the current situation in Germany makes a few things painfully clear. Public memory \u2014 the way pasts are kept as common parts of our shared social fabric \u2014 is a critical resource without which the very idea of a shared humanity is inconceivable. Public memory, as such, can never be owned. The profound intergenerational grief that comes in the wake of historical traumas is a painful legacy, but a conversation about the contemporary meaning of that legacy cannot be avoided if \u201cnever again\u201d is to remain a political ethic responsive to our present. We need to keep having this conversation, lest we resign ourselves to a world in which \u201cnever again\u201d will always only mean \u201cnever again, next time.\u201d Manuel Schwab is a professor of anthropology at the American University in Cairo who lives and works part time in Berlin.", "pubDate": "2023-12-17 11:15:12", "image_url": null, "source_id": "latimes", "source_priority": 267, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "9a5e14fbdfbf7cedad8d88823bde4fbe", "title": "University Presidents Under Fire", "link": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/12/25/university-presidents-under-fire", "keywords": ["Magazine / Comment"], "creator": ["Jeannie Suk Gersen"], "video_url": null, "description": "No one should be duped into applauding a McCarthyesque spectacle of members of Congress demanding firings by universities.", "content": "On a wet afternoon in late September, Claudine Gay, the first Black president of Harvard University, delivered her inaugural address. Gay, who had previously been the dean of Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said that knowledge is best served \u201cwhen we commit to open inquiry and freedom of expression as foundational values of our academic community,\u201d adding that a diversity \u201cof backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives\u201d enables \u201cthe learning that happens when ideas and opinions collide.\u201d The past several years, of course, have seen an erosion of academic freedom. From book bans to the notion that offensive ideas make one unsafe, both the right and the left have participated in curtailing open inquiry. As dean, Gay built a reputation for prizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, which are often perceived as intolerant of viewpoints\u2014say, that marriage is limited to a man and a woman, or affirmative action is discriminatory, or there are only two biological sexes\u2014that may offend marginalized groups. At her inauguration, she warned that diverse viewpoints \u201ccan be a recipe for discomfort, fired in the heat of social media and partisan rancor,\u201d and that this can \u201cmake us vulnerable to a rhetoric of control and containment that has no place in the academy.\u201d A week later came the attack of October 7th. The shocking severity of Hamas\u2019s slaughter, rape, and kidnapping of Israelis had not yet sunk in, but that same day thirty-four Harvard student organizations issued a statement holding \u201cthe Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,\u201d because of its previous actions in Gaza. The backlash was swift. Some called for disciplinary measures. The hedge-fund C.E.O. Bill Ackman, a Harvard alumnus, demanded that the names of the organizations\u2019 members be released, so that potential employers could avoid hiring them. A truck in Harvard Square displayed students\u2019 faces with the caption \u201cHarvard\u2019s leading antisemites.\u201d Denunciations came from lawmakers, including the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, of New York, an ardent Trump supporter and a Harvard alumna. On October 9th, Gay and the university\u2019s deans issued a statement emphasizing \u201cour common humanity\u201d and \u201cgoodwill in a time of unimaginable loss and sorrow,\u201d but did not explicitly condemn Hamas or rebuke the student groups. Gay\u2019s successive pronouncements condemning the terror attack and denouncing antisemitism and introducing an advisory group to address it created an unfortunate appearance of her being pushed to say whatever might quell the public-relations storm. When she defended free speech in response to calls to curb anti-Israel or antisemitic statements, critics cried hypocrisy, noting that Harvard intervenes in incidents of alleged racist and sexist speech, under the rubric of harassment and discrimination policies\u2014though not to the punitive degree the critics were demanding. If Gay hoped to implement the free-expression vision of her inaugural address, the furor was derailing it. Many academic-freedom proponents yearned for the University of Chicago\u2019s Kalven principles, which require university leaders not to issue statements on social and political matters, so that the university can be a neutral forum for diverse viewpoints, political protest, and candid discussion. But in November, amid pressure to punish protesters chanting \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d Gay declared, \u201cI condemn this phrase.\u201d To some, including Hamas, the slogan advocates eliminating Israel or the Jewish presence in the Middle East, but to others it advocates freedom and equality for Palestinians. During the December 5th congressional hearing on campus antisemitism, Representative Stefanik insisted that such slogans are genocidal. As she and other Republican lawmakers grilled three university presidents\u2014Gay; Liz Magill, of the University of Pennsylvania; and Sally Kornbluth, of M.I.T.\u2014she asked, \u201cDoes calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard\u2019s rules on bullying and harassment?\u201d Gay said that it can, \u201cdepending on the context.\u201d Kornbluth and Magill offered similar responses. Stefanik declared them \u201cunacceptable.\u201d The claim that the answer depends on context is correct; any responsible determination of a policy violation is context-dependent. In the context of October 7th, it would have been clearer to say something like \u201cYes, calling for a person to be killed because they are Jewish or Palestinian would constitute bullying and harassment. And, if the phrase \u2018from the river to sea\u2019 was used specifically to threaten to kill someone, that would at a minimum violate the rules.\u201d It is unlikely, however, that any correct answer would have been acceptable. The presidents walked into an ambush, having prepared for a deposition (where counsel advises minimalist answers) rather than for political grandstanding. And the moment plainly needed a moral statement rather than a legally precise reply. More than seventy congresspeople demanded that all three presidents be fired. Magill was already vulnerable\u2014donors had rescinded funds in response to Penn\u2019s hosting a Palestinian literary festival, in September, to which a speaker who had been accused of antisemitism (and denied it) was invited\u2014and she resigned. Stefanik responded, \u201cOne down. Two to go.\u201d The fact that the presidents are women and that Gay is Black made them a target for attacking diversity and equating it with being unqualified. Ackman commented that \u201cshrinking the pool of candidates based on required race, gender, and/or sexual orientation criteria is not the right approach to identifying the best leaders for our most prestigious universities.\u201d But, after seven hundred faculty members (I was among them) urged Harvard\u2019s governing board \u201cto resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard\u2019s commitment to academic freedom,\u201d the board unanimously supported Gay\u2019s continuing as president, writing, \u201cWe champion open discourse and academic freedom.\u201d No one should be duped into applauding a McCarthyesque spectacle of members of Congress demanding firings by universities. Last year, Stefanik co-sponsored the Restoring Academic Freedom on Campus Act, claiming that some universities, in their devotion to \u201cFar Left woke ideology,\u201d had failed in the task of \u201cencouraging diversity of ideas.\u201d Some conservatives appear to think that the wave of moral panic they are riding will somehow bring about more freedom of expression. But inciting rage over not punishing antisemitic speech, or speech that they take to be antisemitic, will place pressure on universities to create or toughen codes to restrict even more speech. Here\u2019s hoping that universities will have the courage to level up on academic freedom rather than down. \u2666", "pubDate": "2023-12-17 11:00:00", "image_url": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/657b5ea63a0475157a913215/master/pass/Comment-Gersen-12-15-23.jpg", "source_id": "newyorker", "source_priority": 776, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "f498b1573fbdb099f2d1e5f5e993e4aa", "title": "Harvard seeks to move past antisemitism controversy", "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4362225-harvard-antisemitism-controversy-gay-penn-mit/", "keywords": ["Education", "antisemitism", "Claudine Gay", "Harvard"], "creator": ["Lexi Lonas"], "video_url": null, "description": "Harvard University has a difficult job ahead as it works to rebuild trust in its community and try to move on from the fallout of its president\u2019s testimony before Congress.

Unlike the head of the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Harvard chief Claudine Gay was able to keep her position after international backlash when two the leaders, as well as the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), refused to say that a call for Jewish genocide would constitute harassment. Those invested in the campus culture say Harvard needs to begin an open process of remedying its policies to earn their trust back. Roni Brunn, a leading member of the Harvard Jewish Alumni Association, said the university needs to be \u201ctransparent\u201d in its next steps. She lamented the vague statements and promises from Harvard that students who have crossed the line into antisemitism are facing repercussions. \u201cThe other thing about it is that Harvard, they\u2019re saying that they did take some disciplinary action to students, but it\u2019s held in private,\u201d Brunn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing announced, so people are not deterred by whatever administrative disciplinary action is taken.

Foxx said the schools could face subpoenas and further calls for testimony as part of the probe. The Department of Education has also opened inquiries into Harvard and UPenn over allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Brunn also pointed to the committee on antisemitism that Gay assembled weeks ago, saying no one knows what\u2019s going on in their meetings and the only insight they have had is when Rabbi David Wolpe quit. In his parting statement, Wolpe said that \u201cthe ideology that grips far too many of [Harvard\u2019s] students and faculty, the ideology that works only along axes of oppression and places Jews as oppressors and therefore intrinsically evil, is itself evil.\u201d Unlike Gay, UPenn\u2019s Liz Magill was unable to survive the controversy and was ousted by her school\u2019s board, even after she released a statement walking back her testimony to Congress. \u201cIn that moment, I was focused on our university\u2019s longstanding policies aligned with the U.S. Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable,\u201d Magill said. \u201cI was not focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It\u2019s evil \u2014 plain and simple.\u201d MIT\u2019s president, meanwhile, quickly received the support of her school\u2019s board despite so far releasing no statement going back or apologizing for her congressional testimony. Gay told The Harvard Crimson, the school\u2019s student newspaper, that she was \u201csorry\u201d for her House testimony. \u201cI got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community \u2014 threats to our Jewish students \u2014 have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.\u201d Harvard\u2019s next moves are important as one of the most prestigious colleges in the country, with other schools looking to it for guidance, said Jacqueline Pfeffer Merril, director of the Campus Free Expression Project for the Bipartisan Policy Center The defensive position the presidents were in during the hearing \u201cerodes the confidence and trust of the public in our entire system of higher education,\u201d Merril said. \u201cAnd so I think as an entire sector one of the questions is how is it that we rebuild trust in higher education as institutions of learning, of expertise, of genuinely open debate?\u201d she added. The first step in that process, Merril said, is revisiting free speech and expression policies on campus to provide \u201crobust protection for free speech\u201d and apply the standards in a neutral matter. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a free speech organization, conducts surveys on the culture of free expression on college campuses, and Harvard ranked last on the list, though the university disputes the methods of the organization. \u201cSecond, as part of the educational mission, there should be a concerted effort to prepare students to tolerate views with which they deeply disagree and to engage in civil and productive discourse,\u201d Merril said. Free speech advocates have come to the defense of the university presidents after their testimonies, saying the leaders were correct that the First Amendment allows those types of comments on campus depending on the context. \u201cThe bottom line is that harassment is a pattern of targeted behavior. For example, it\u2019s hard to see how the single utterance Rep. Elise Stefanik asked about during the hearing \u2014 no matter how offensive \u2014 would qualify given this pervasiveness requirement,\u201d FIRE said. \u201cAnd as frustrating as it is to hear the college presidents\u2019 appeals to \u2018context\u2019 in yesterday\u2019s hearing, particularly when it doesn\u2019t seem to matter to them when other speech is at issue, the truth is that context does matter,\u201d FIRE added. Harvard has been in the spotlight since the start of the Israel-Hamas war when 30 student-led groups released a statement saying it was Israel\u2019s fault Hamas attacked on Oct. 7 and killed more than 1,500 civilians. Since then, protests with calls to \u201cFree Palestine from the River to the Sea\u201d and other divisive slogans have been held on the Cambridge, Mass., campus. \u201cConsidering this conflict is going to go on for several more months, and I assume there will be other additional protests at Harvard, we are going to be keeping Harvard under a microscope,\u201d said Ron Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington. This time around, Halber said he thinks Gay was \u201cgenuinely remorseful\u201d for her words and had a \u201cmoment to learn.\u201d But if \u201cshe fails to meet the test again, she needs to go,\u201d Halber said. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind,\u201d Halber added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, by the way, against the Jewish community but against any community.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-12-17 11:00:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/gayclaudine_120523mn01_w.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "38a130221b3010b9073bed8ba444780b", "title": "The Chancellor of Berkeley Weighs In", "link": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/the-chancellor-of-berkeley-weighs-in", "keywords": ["News / The New Yorker Interview"], "creator": ["Molly Fischer"], "video_url": null, "description": "Carol Christ reflects on campus protests, then and now.", "content": "When Carol Christ first joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, more than fifty years ago, she remembers a new colleague giving her a half-joking piece of advice: don\u2019t bother preparing the last three weeks of your class, because you\u2019ll never get to teach them\u2014the students will all be out on strike. Protest has been part of her experience at Berkeley throughout her career there, first as an English professor (she specializes in Victorian literature) and later as an administrator; apart from an eleven-year stint as the president of Smith College, in the early two-thousands, the university has been her professional home. She assumed its top leadership role\u2014chancellor\u2014in 2017, and announced last summer that she would retire in 2024. The job of heading a college or university has rarely come under greater public scrutiny than in the past two months. Since the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel and the beginning of the Israeli assault on Gaza, campuses across the country have seen a wave of protests\u2014and accompanying accusations of both Islamophobia and antisemitism. There have been demonstrations, open letters, official statements, follow-up official statements, confrontations, threats, anger, and fear. At Cornell, campus police placed the Center for Jewish Living under guard; at Columbia, the administration pro-Palestinian student groups. At Berkeley, students organized a mass on behalf of Palestine. During the walkout, a student carrying an Israeli flag was allegedly hit with a water bottle, an incident that\u2019s now among the campus conditions cited in a alleging antisemitism at the law school. Earlier this month, the presidents of Harvard, M.I.T, and the University of Pennsylvania testified before Congress in a hearing titled \u201cHolding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism.\u201d Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Trump-aligned Republican, went viral with her questioning, in which she pushed the presidents to say whether \u201ccalling for the genocide of Jews\u201d violated their institutions\u2019 rules. Their responses, which parsed definitions of protected speech, inspired widespread outrage. Liz Magill resigned as president of Penn a few days later. Claudine Gay faced calls to step down as president of Harvard, but maintained the governing board\u2019s support. Christ spoke to me over Zoom from her office. After a turbulent semester, the campus seemed quiet, she said\u2014it was finals week, and students were focussed on their work. The question on the horizon: \u201cWhat do we do when the spring semester starts?\u201d She\u2019d been thinking about the Vietnam War, and the teach-ins she attended in her own student days. \u201cYou went to learn; they weren\u2019t shouting matches,\u201d she told me. \u201cI wonder if we can use something like that.\u201d In our interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, she discussed her hope that through free speech, the Berkeley community can find a way to navigate \u201calmost existential differences of opinion.\u201d What I think a president or chancellor needs to do is make space for all students. In other words, in these days of increasing diversity of all sorts on college campuses, what the president or chancellor, I believe, needs to do is to create a sense of belonging, of membership in the campus community, for all students. And that means, in relation to a very divisive issue like the current conflict, you of course want to express sympathy, compassion, and empathy for the extraordinary suffering that has gone on in the Middle East; the loss of life; the way in which students are deeply, deeply affected, feel unsafe, feel harassed, and are just deeply caught up in this conflict. At the same time, I think it\u2019s wrong for someone in this position\u2014although this is controversial, and many people, particularly outside universities, don\u2019t have sympathy with this point of view\u2014to take sides or to pass judgment on one party or the other. One of the really interesting things about universities in general is that they have an enormous range of both individuals and groups who feel that they have an ownership stake. So it\u2019s not as hierarchical a structure as you would think. Whether it\u2019s alumni or donors or students, staff, faculty\u2014all of them feel with passion that they have an ownership stake, and should be able to have a major voice in positions that the institution takes. I have not been in a crisis in which presidents\u2019\u2014or, in my case, chancellors\u2019\u2014words have seemed so important. And not just but, rather, very particular words. You must use this word; you must not use this word. Sometimes I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m in a situation in which there are at least two, sometimes I think more, speech codes that people are using to represent their sense of the situation. There\u2019s a speech code if you\u2019re representing the situation of Israel, in anger and with a sense of its violation, and there\u2019s a speech code if you\u2019re speaking about the Palestinian history in Gaza and the West Bank, and often the words are the same. But they mean something different and they apply to different things. This situation is so different from other situations of controversy in that it has really split the student body. If you go way back to the Free Speech Movement, for example, that was the students versus the administration\u2014not a lot of controversy among students.The shape of this particular situation is really different because there is a deep, deep division on the campus. I think it\u2019s very different now. There\u2019s hardly an event in the world that happens where I don\u2019t get pressure to make a statement. I think in part it reflects the time rhythms and the digital media of our news world right now. Before there was the Internet, if you made a statement, you would spend a lot of time writing it. It was a long process. I\u2019ve very rarely had not only \u201cMake a statement\u201d but also \u201cLet me read the statement first and revise it before you make it.\u201d From campus groups\u2014they want to read the statement, want to revise the statement, want sometimes to write the statement. It\u2019s a very interesting way of claiming \u201cI am seen\u201d\u2014by writing the words that represent the situation, whatever the situation is. I think it\u2019s a relatively recent development. I don\u2019t remember it ever happening when I was president of Smith, even though that was post-Internet. I\u2019m not sure I can claim there\u2019s one event. Certainly the murder of George Floyd was an event in which I think most presidents spoke up. I didn\u2019t watch the testimony, so all I\u2019ve read are news accounts. It\u2019s striking to me that all three presidents are new presidents, and that all three presidents are women\u2014so there\u2019s a kind of symmetry that I think wasn\u2019t intended in their appearance. I also think one of the things that has happened is that there\u2019s a narrative about higher education, generally, that\u2019s politically useful to some groups in this country, and this very difficult situation with Israel and with Palestine is getting absorbed into that narrative. I also think that there is a tension between Title VI protections and First Amendment protections, and that hasn\u2019t really been tried in court. I think it may be a very interesting product of this moment. One of the ways in which I\u2019ve tried to frame my comments about the current situation is our . I say often, to lots of different audiences, \u201cJust because you have the right to say something doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s right to say.\u201d The protections in our society, I think quite rightfully, are extraordinarily broad for free speech. When I talk about them, I often talk about John Stuart Mill and what he says about the marketplace of ideas, and how it\u2019s only by having bad ideas colliding with good ideas that the truth comes out in our age of disinformation. I\u2019m not sure how much Mill\u2019s arguments about free speech really hold up. But, nonetheless, that\u2019s certainly the idea for free speech. And the question about censorship of speech is always \u201cWho\u2019s the censor? Who has the power to determine what can\u2019t be said?\u201d And is that a step down a slippery slope that leads to restrictions that many people would not want on free speech? And is therefore the consequence of people sometimes saying abhorrent things with the legal license to do so\u2014is that the price that we pay for not having that censoring authority? One of the things that\u2019s exciting about universities is you have this community that\u2019s constantly changing. You can\u2019t say, \u201cOh, I said that already.\u201d Because it\u2019s a new audience that\u2019s there. Universities are places where students are for a time while they get their degree. But that means that you always have new people who may not understand how to act in a community. I myself believe that the pandemic has really reduced, generally, people\u2019s social skills. So you have students coming here, also adults coming here, who have real gaps in their usual social experience because of the pandemic. The very nature of students\u2014it\u2019s why I love them, I love being with them\u2014is that it\u2019s these years between eighteen and your early twenties when you\u2019re forming your identity, and young people of that age sometimes believe things and say things with a kind of absolutism that will be foreign to them later in their life. And that\u2019s in part what gives university communities their character\u2014the stage of life of a very big part of their population. Oh, gosh, it\u2019s always hard to say what kind of advice you would give somebody you don\u2019t know. But I think in part what has happened is when you\u2019re in one of these jobs for a while, you have relationships. I certainly have alumni who have felt that my statements haven\u2019t gone far enough, who have been very, very distressed by what\u2019s happening on campus\u2014but they tend to call me up. When you have relationships, it becomes in some ways easier to have the conversation, because you have some credibility with people. What I always say is \u201cListen\u2014you\u2019ll learn from what you hear.\u201d I certainly have learned from listening to our Jewish students, from listening to our Palestinian and Muslim students. And what I hear, paradoxically, both groups saying is \u201cSee my pain. See where I am.\u201d Both groups to a certain extent feel unseen, either on the particular campus or, more generally, in the world. I think the task for us all is to try to figure out how we can bring together people of sharply differing views, and have them talk to each other with civility and respect. We had two faculty members here, Ron Hassner and Hatem Bazian, and they wrote together to their students, saying, We disagree about everything; we vehemently disagree, but we have always treated each other with civility and respect, and this is what we are asking of you. One of the things that really struck me when I got to Smith is that something inappropriate, mean, prejudiced that one student might say to another in the dining hall could become a campus crisis like . There was very little separation between the private world and the institutional world. Here, if a student said something awful to another student in the dining hall\u2014I\u2019m sure it goes on, but you\u2019d never know about it. At Berkeley, what there is is public space. People come here to protest because it gets in the newspaper. Places like Berkeley and Harvard, they make news. And they can serve as shorthand for an idea of an institution that people may want to use, for negative purposes or for positive purposes. So there\u2019s a difference between public space and private space. I always thought, when I was at Smith, that I didn\u2019t have enough public space, and at Berkeley, the public space overwhelms. It predominates. It\u2019s the picture on Sproul Plaza. It\u2019s the banner that\u2019s hanging off the Campanile, rather than the conversation that should be happening between people who have different ideas about things. I think it\u2019s wrong. We owe all of our students support both in getting through their education and then also finding a place of employment after their education. So I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a very good pressure point. Obviously, when an employer hires somebody, they make lots of judgments. I do it all the time when I hire people. But to say in a blanket way you shouldn\u2019t ever hire a student who holds this political belief\u2014I don\u2019t know. It rubs me the wrong way. It\u2019s terrible. We don\u2019t have a lot of control over those trucks; if they\u2019re driving around the city streets, we can\u2019t stop them. What I do is I\u2019ve offered to write a letter of recommendation for any student who has been doxed in that way, if they are a student in good standing, to say they\u2019re a student in good standing and say what I can about them. I can\u2019t really speak for the people who have developed the suit, but I think the current terrible, tragic, violent situation has reactivated their opposition to student organizations that express preference about point of view in their speakers. I knew how critical it was to do whatever we had to to allow very conservative speakers to be able to speak on campus without being shouted down, without their event being cancelled, without riots happening. And so we took extraordinary measures. The first thing that I learned was how important it was to defend the rights of free speech, even when the person\u2019s point of view\u2014like Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s to me\u2014was just abhorrent. Another thing that I learned was how important it was for the community to have the conversation about free speech. The community was highly critical of the way in which I brought in enough police presence to enable the next conservative speaker who was invited to campus to be able to speak\u2014and so we had a free-speech commission, we had lots of hearings. One of the things that you learn as a leader of an institution like this is, what you have to do is in some way embed the conversation in the community by having the opportunity for a lot of people to have it and to have it with different views. I thought it was a real reputational damage. \u201cBerkeley is a place where conservative speakers can\u2019t speak.\u201d It was not only damage in the eyes of a larger public but some of our alums said, \u201cWhat is this? Why can\u2019t a conservative speaker speak at Berkeley?\u201d And then it just answers to my own principles for the university. The university is a place where you debate ideas. It\u2019s not just a place where you hear the ideas that make you comfortable. You should hear the ideas that make you not so comfortable, or you should hear people argue them back and forth. If not us, where? And so making the conditions for that seems, to me, very important. Absolutely, students have to be safe\u2014end sentence, full stop. And that means physically safe, and it also means safe from targeted harassment. Doxing. We have pretty robust complaint procedures for people who believe that they have been harassed or doxed. And we\u2019re actually hiring lots of extra help to try to go through what has been a huge increase in the number of complaints we\u2019ve been getting. We\u2019ve also increased our investment in security, as well as using observers more who can intervene if something seems to be getting out of control. One of the things that is very troubling to me, although I guess it\u2019s understandable, is the sense of intense fragility\u2014that physical fragility and vulnerability that students feel. And what I want to say is, \u201cThe campus is a pretty safe place\u201d\u2014which it is, but then you have terrible incidents like the young man who was on the Stanford campus, or these three young men who were . And so there are incidents that I think reinforce the sense that students keep sharing with me that they don\u2019t feel physically safe. When I was a student, we wanted to be independent! We didn\u2019t want anything to do with the restrictions of an older generation. Now students want to be both psychologically and physically assured of their safety. I don\u2019t know whether this has to do with maybe changes in parenting styles or what. However, I went to white-majority schools. Now our campuses are a lot more diverse, and I think that creates more fragility around the idea of belonging, which can bleed over into a sense of lack of safety. Also, this is a generation of students that grew up, through grammar school, with anti-bullying instruction. And so I think there is more sensitivity. But there\u2019s also the permission that an online world gives to irresponsible speech\u2014saying things that you would never say in person. I think there\u2019s also been a huge shift since the pandemic. The kind of fragility that I\u2019ve seen is much more pronounced since the pandemic. During Vietnam, there was this real sense of agency. Students discovered that young people could have a role in history\u2014that was the overwhelming sense of the sixties, whether it was the civil-rights movement, or the protests against the Vietnam War, or the Third World college strike at Berkeley. When I compare what\u2019s happening now, there seems to be almost a sense of helplessness. There\u2019s this situation in the Middle East that it is so grievous in so many ways\u2014so horrible to think about, so horrible to look at when you watch the news or read the newspaper. And people are angry; they feel angst. And they also feel a sense of real impotence about it. So it seems quite different in that regard than the protests of the sixties. It\u2019s not enjoyable. But I understand the impulse of it. It\u2019s a form of American activism. And so long as students pay attention to the , it\u2019s a legitimate form of the expression of group social opinion. First of all, literature teaches you empathy. You can\u2019t read novels without having to shift your empathy, your sympathy, your understanding of people coming from very, very different places. The book that I\u2019m reading right now is \u2014the title is \u201c ,\u201d and it\u2019s about his difficulty in being a Vietnamese immigrant, from a family that had seen a lot of suffering in Vietnam, in the United States. And of course there are parts of this book that make me uncomfortable, and there are parts that are deeply illuminating about that experience. And, being a professor of literature, you\u2019re used to paying a lot of attention to words, and words have been so fundamental to this current crisis. You mentioned before Steven Davidoff Solomon\u2019s op-ed in the . Just in the past two or three days, there\u2019s been by another one of our faculty, Ron Hassner, and it\u2019s about \u201cfrom the river to the sea.\u201d And it\u2019s really interesting. One of the points he makes is that some students\u2014and I\u2019ve learned this from talking with students\u2014don\u2019t understand it the way some Jews understand it. One of the things I certainly have learned from this crisis is that there are certainly moral absolutes\u2014there is nothing you can say that in any way rationalizes the barbarity of the Hamas attack on Israel. But people don\u2019t always use words with the understanding of how they sound to someone else. And you see that all the time in an incredibly painful way in the current situation. I\u2019m not at all calling for a moral relativism; I\u2019m just saying that people aren\u2019t hearing their words with the ears of another. And they\u2019re often ignorant of the history that leaves those words to resonate in a certain way. While I will refrain from criticizing or second-guessing the presidents who appeared before Congress, the aftermath offers ample evidence of the perils and challenges higher education is facing at that intersection of free speech, diversity of perspective, and the essential import of civil discourse for strong campus communities. At Berkeley we have been grappling with some of these issues for years if only because as a public university we have far less discretion than private institutions when it comes to First Amendment compliance. At Berkeley we would strongly condemn any advocacy for genocide against the Jewish people. And our response to that hate speech would not stop with condemnation. This campus can and will discipline hate speech not protected by the First Amendment. Any speech not protected by the First Amendment would, by definition, violate the Student and Faculty Codes of Conduct. And, even if that hate speech was protected, it would not stop Berkeley from strongly condemning it and marshalling the university\u2019s educational resources to address the evil and the ignorance at the heart of any call for genocide against the Jewish people. Yet, I am certain that even this commitment\u2014which is as far as we can go under the law\u2014will sound far from sufficient to some, and an unwarranted over-reaction to others. \u2666", "pubDate": "2023-12-17 11:00:00", "image_url": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/657a0740c6403b9c12507ea1/master/pass/Fischer-Carol-Christ-lead.jpg", "source_id": "newyorker", "source_priority": 776, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "98a28c4a38583a6d80154bc227d32fa8", "title": "Massive far-right event is reportedly packed with people who have 'a dim view of the Jews'", "link": "https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/massive-far-right-event-is-reportedly-packed-with-people-who-have-a-dim-fbcb7af894929c061ca4d4c069d813fe8cadc14c?source=rss", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "A gathering of far-right personalities is reportedly expected to be packed with patriotism... and antisemitism.Turning Point USA's \"AmericaFest\" is kicking off on Saturday, but Rolling Stone has highlighted some of its more controversial acts.TPUSA is run by Charlie Kirk, who has himself been\u2026 - www.rawstory.com", "content": "A gathering of far-right personalities is reportedly expected to be packed with patriotism... and antisemitism.
